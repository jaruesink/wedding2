    <h5>September 11, 2015</h5>
    <p>
      After a long summer of coaching cheer camp, Jackie was finally able to visit a sand volleyball hangout with young adults that her boss had been inviting her to all summer.
      Soon after Jackie arrived, she found herself playing with a cute dog named Stella. Not long passed before a rather sandy and sweaty dude came up and introduced himself as Jake, the dog's owner.
      Jake knew everyone there and spent the time running between playing volleyball, checking on his dog, and talking with the group where Jackie was sitting.
      With the night coming to an end, Jake was excited about an upcoming trip to an Aggie football game with his friend Luke. Feeling inclusive, he decided to test the waters and invite Stella's new friend along.
      Since Jackie's summer camp partner and friend Savannah was also going, it didn't take much convincing to get her to join them.

      The day started off early with a trip to stock up with their tailgating equipment, before hitting the road to good ol' Cstat.
      Savannah and Jackie soon found themselves diving head first into a crazy college football enviroment for a team they were reluctant to root for.
      An hour before the game started, the group decided to take a chance and attempt to get the full experience of Aggie football.
      They were quickly able to find tickets at a good price and headed in the stadium to find their seats. They ended up walking up to the very top directly underneath the scoreboard, Jackie's personal nightmare.
      Jackie was a bit freaked out about the height, the loud bangs of the nearby cannon, and the fireworks shooting off directly overhead, when Jake decided to add to the nerves by reaching for Jackie's hand.

      It had been nearly a full week since the football game and Jackie had yet to hear from Jake. Since Jake had held Jackie's hand, she had been expecting to hear from him at some point during the week.
      Jake didn't have her number, so he didn't make a move. However, they were friends on facebook so, feeling bold, Jackie messaged Jake asking if she was going to see him at volleyball again.
      Jake was clueless that Jackie had even thought about him at all that week, and as soon as Jackie sent that message, they haven't stopped talking since.

      Another week passed, but by this time Jake is messaging Jackie everyday.
      Jackie was excited about the Super Blood Moon Lunar Eclipse that was happening, so they packed an impromptu late-night picnic to watch the moon turn red in Old Settler’s park.
      They spent the evening telling each other their life stories, both secretly wondering if they were becoming a thing.
      Jackie even interrogated Jake, asking him to share the Gospel with her in order to get a better idea of his theology.
      Jake must have passed, because he will soon ask Jackie out on an official date and she will soon say yes.

      Jake and Jackie (and Stella) went on their first official date to Blue Starlite Drive-In Movies where
      they ate hotdogs and s’mores while watching a double feature of old Hitchcock mysteries.
      Stella began realizing that Jackie was stealing some of Jake's attention from her and began to get jealous. To this day, she's never really gotten over Jackie stealing Jake's heart.

      Round 2 of Aggie football. Somehow Jake was able to convince Jackie to head to back to Cstat for another game.
      This time, however, there were no nearby cannons or heights or fireworks. Instead, there was lunch with Jake's entire extended family. (No pressure).
      This time, they watched the game from the safety of the ground while eating burgers and playing cornhole. This time, Jackie held Jake's hand a lot.
      During half-time of the game, Jake showed Jackie around the George Bush Library's Garden where he officially asked her to be his girlfriend.
      Jackie basically knew from here on out that Jake was her guy.

    <p>
      After a few awesome months of dating and growing in the Lord together, Jake was being sent to Dallas for what would be the first of a few months of traveling for work.
      They would still get to see each other on weekends, but not as often as they had gotten used to which made Jackie sad. 
      Before he left her house, Jake let’s Jackie know "I hope you know I love you. Because I do."
      This was the first time Jake said the "L" word to Jackie, and for her the feeling had been mutual for a while.

      Life went on and Jake and Jackie grew closer together. They came to understand the sanctifying work of loving and appreciating their opposite personality types and looked forward to their future together.
      Ready to start that journey, Jake met Jackie at the Westin to eat dinner there at a restaurant called Stella.
      Since it is out of character for Jake to pick a fancy restaurant at a hotel, he intentionally mentioned that he wanted to try it only for his dog.
      They got dessert and brought it up to the rooftop to view the sunset.
      Before Jackie even knew what was happening, an excited Jake got down on one knee and eloquently quipped, "Wanna marry me? I got you a ring... do you want to see it?"
      She said yes. Of course she did, she had been asking for a ring for a while.
      Jake slipped the ring on her finger while his roommate, Derek, met them with flowers and a camera for a quick photoshoot.
